            answer:
                "On average, a single 100mg Viagra pill in the United States can set you back about $70-85. When you add up all the expenses involved in getting Viagra in the traditional way, like doctor fees and other medical costs, the total monthly expenditure may soar beyond $400. Now, with Uplink Health, you can acquire Generic Viagra (Sildenafil Citrate) 90% cheaper than your local pharmacy with exact same safety, effectiveness, and potency.",
